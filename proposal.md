# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mario 1-1

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to make a Mario level that looks like World 1-1 in New Super Mario Bros DS.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will act as a Mario game. The user will be able to move Mario forwards, backwards, and jump up in the air. Some features of the game would include green grass for the floor, a blue sky, blocks to jump into and a gap to jump across. I would like to make this whole project in Python and/or VS Code. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my project is if my game works. If controlling Mario feels a little clunky to the user when it is played, I will not be disappointed as long as the game works. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my final project would be is if it my game looks similar to a Mario level. Along with the game working, I would like my game to at least somewhat resemble a Mario level, even if the gameplay is not smooth.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best possible outcome is if my game looks and feels smooth when it is played. Also, if I could add clouds in the sky and Princess Peache's castle in the background, I would be extremely happy with that.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In order to create the final project I want to make, I will first watch the tutorials on Canvas. I will need to research how to code Mario because in the tutorials, instead of Mario, it is an alien. A few skills I will need to acquire while working on the final project is working with both spritesheets and tilemaps. I will also need to research what program is best to make a game like this in because I still have some doubts on which program to use.
